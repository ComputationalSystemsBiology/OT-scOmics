## Running on Colab GPU

This notebook is designed to be run on GPU. If you do not have access to a GPU you may want to use the (free) Google Colab platform to run this notebook. For that, you can access the notebook at this link: [colab.research.google.com/github/ComputationalSystemsBiology/.../OT_scOmics.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ComputationalSystemsBiology/OT-scOmics/blob/main/OT_scOmics.ipynb)

Please make sure that the GPU is enabled. Navigate to "Edit→Notebook Settings" and select "GPU" from the "Hardware Accelerator" drop-down.
